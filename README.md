# Zomato Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis
This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Zomato dataset, focusing on understanding various aspects of the data such as missing values, numerical and categorical variables exploration, finding relationships between features, and deriving insights from the data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is available in the file zomato.csv. Additionally, the country code information is extracted from Country-Code.xlsx to enhance the analysis.

## Installation
To run the analysis locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your_username/zomato-eda.git
2. Install the required dependencies. You can do this by running:
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Make sure you have the dataset files zomato.csv and Country-Code.xlsx in the project directory.
4. Run the Jupyter notebook Zomato_EDA.ipynb to execute the analysis.

## Usage
The Jupyter notebook Zomato_EDA.ipynb contains all the code for the exploratory data analysis. You can execute each cell in the notebook to perform the analysis step by step.

## Results
The analysis includes:

## Handling missing values
- Exploring numerical and categorical variables
- Finding relationships between features
- Visualizations such as pie charts, bar plots, and count plots to understand various aspects of the data
- Insights derived from the data exploration process
  
## Conclusion
The exploratory data analysis provides valuable insights into the Zomato dataset, including the distribution of ratings, popular cuisines, countries with online delivery options, and more.
